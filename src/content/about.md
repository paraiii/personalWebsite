## Philosophy

I believe good software is not just functional â€” it should be elegant, maintainable, and user-centric. Whether it's improving accessibility, refactoring complex flows, or introducing better developer tooling, I enjoy iterating toward clean, modular solutions that scale.

## Current Focus

I'm currently deepening my work across interactive system design, real-world API integration, and architecture for complex flows. I'm also exploring design systems, signals/reactivity patterns, and applying AI to streamline development workflows.
